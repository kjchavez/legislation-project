        <p>The GovTrack dataset provides the text of bills introduced on the
        floor of both the House and the Senate. There are a lot of interesting
        applications of this data, but first, let's get a sense of the language
        used by our legislators. We built a language model of bills as they
        were introduced (before any modifications) to the House of
        representatives.</p>

	<h2>The Data</h2>
	<p>
	We extracted all of the bills introduced by the House of Representatives from
  the 103rd Congress to the 115th Congress (1993 - 2017). A few quick stats:
	<ul>
	  <li>72,243 individual bills</li>
	  <li>198,145,728 tokens (words or special punctuation)</li>
	  <li>Average bill length: 2740 tokens</li>
	</ul>

	There are a few <strong>really</strong> long <a
    href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2009/11/gop-wrote-5-of-10-longest-bills-023067">bills</a>,
  but most are captured in the cumulative distribution below. A point (x, y) on
  this plot states that a fraction <var>y</var> of bills are less than or equal
  to <var>x</var> tokens (~words) long.

	<h2>The Fun Interactive Part</h2>
	<p>
	One good way to get a sense for the language model we've trained is to look
  at samples from it. You can change the temperature to increase/decrease the
  variability in the sample.

	<h2>The Model and Training</h2>
	We use a 2-layer LSTM model. The instance served by this page has the following parameters:

	<table class="table">
	<tr>
    <td>Parameter</td>
    <td>Value</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Embedding Dim</td>
    <td>200</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Hidden Layer Dim</td>
    <td>200</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Vocab Size</td>
    <td>10000</td>
	</tr>
	</table>

  <p>Of the approx. 72K bills, we partition into <strong>57795</strong> bills
  for training, <strong>7224</strong> for validation, and <strong>7224</strong> for a
  test set.</p>

  <p>The model is trained using vanilla SGD with an exponentially decaying learning rate, batch size of 20,
  unroll length of 20, and clipped gradients. See <a href="#">hparams.yaml</a>
  for full details.</p>

  <p>The model served by this page hit an entropy of 60 on the test set.</p>
